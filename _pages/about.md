I am a cybersecurity professional specializing in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, with expertise in Splunk and IBM QRadar. I have extensive experience in implementing, managing, and optimizing SIEM platforms to enhance threat detection and incident response. My work includes developing advanced correlation rules, conducting log analysis, and integrating security automation to strengthen enterprise security operations.

In addition to my SIEM expertise, I have a strong background in anomaly detection using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. I design and deploy AI-driven models to identify abnormal patterns, detect zero-day threats, and improve cybersecurity monitoring. My approach integrates statistical analysis, behavioral modeling, and AI-based analytics to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of threat detection mechanisms.

With hands-on experience in MLOps, I streamline the deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management of machine learning models in production environments. I specialize in automating ML pipelines, ensuring model scalability, and maintaining model performance over time. By combining cybersecurity, AI-driven threat detection, and MLOps best practices, I enhance security operations with robust, data-driven solutions.
